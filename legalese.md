# About

The Spanish Inquisition lives on in the popular imagination more than five
hundred years after it was established in 1478. Monty Python taught us no
one expected it. Mel Brooks turned it into a song. This dark humor worked
to de-fang an institution associated with the worst impulses of religious
intolerance and persecution. This course will look at the long history of
the Spanish Inquisition on the Iberian peninsula and in the Americas to go
beyond secret trails, torture, and autos-da-fe to understand why the
Inquisition was established, its institutional role was in Spanish rule,
and its legacies for the modern world. 

# course objectives

1. To introduce students to the forces, events, and conflicts that defined the
   establishment and operation of the Spanish Inquisition.  
2. To understand and use a variety of sources that provide the core of historical inquiry.  
3. To learn and improve skills in reading, synthesizing, and writing about
   historical scholarship.

# policies

![](http://chadblack.net/511S2012/media/images/disability.png) Qualified
students with disabilities needing appropriate academic adjustments should
contact me as soon as possible to ensure that your needs are met in a timely
manner with appropriate documentation.

**Masks:** The University is currently requiring students, faculty, and staff
to mask indoors. We will comply with this requirement. The Delta variant of
this virus is extremely contagious, with an R0 somewhere [between
5-9](https://www.sfchronicle.com/health/article/CDC-says-the-delta-variant-is-as-contagious-as-16356370.php) (one person will infect
on average 5-9 people). This turns the classroom into
a potentially high-risk situation. Wearing a mask for 75 minutes indoors is
a small price to pay to be back in University community.

**Attendance:** Attendance is mandatory. If you cannot attend, please email
Dr. Black or your TA ahead of time. We're not making an Inquisition into your
absences, so the reasons you can't attend are not as important as giving us the
heads up. If you have *any* symptoms or have been exposed to COVID, please do
not come to class! Just send us a quick email, and get tested.


**Deadlines:** Assignments must uploaded to Canvas by the end of the day on
which they are due. Late papers will not be accepted with out **prior
arrangement**. If you will not be able to complete an assignment on time, you
must contact me and your TA ahead of time. If you contract COVID or some other
illness, please let us know so that we can work with you.


**Cell Phones, Laptops, Zoom:** Cellphones should be put away during class.
Please do not text or post to the Group Me during class. It is very distracting
to people around you, and to the professor. Laptops may be used to take notes,
but I would ask you to seriously consider using paper instead. If you want or
need to use a laptop, please consider sitting towards the back of the room so
as to minimize distractions behind you. If we have to utilize Zoom at some
point, please practice the kind of respectful manners that I'm sure you have
become used to over the last 15 months. In class and on Zoom, I would invite
you to interrupt me with questions during lecture.

Research shows that analog note-taking improves learning. Consider having paper
with you. Based on the prevailing literature, hand note-taking-- both while
reading and in class-- leads to substantially better educational outcomes.
Consider taking notes by hand even though you'll be watching on your computer.


**Drop-in Hours**: Students are strongly encouraged to speak with me and the
TAs outside of class. The advantages include: extra help on an assignment
or preparation for exams; clarification of materials covered in lecture,
discussion of comments on your work; discussion of this or related courses.
I have an open door policy during my drop-in hours. I will be there, and you
are welcome to come by for any reason. Your TAs have the same. I'm also
available via zoom by appointment.

**Changes:** I reserve the write to change this syllabus as the semester
progresses. This is not a contract, but rather a document to guide expectations
and clearly communicate weekly assignments. Please bring the syllabus with you
to our class meetings. Or, keep up with it on the course website. We'll have to
remain flexible as the outlook for our fourth pandemic semester is still
uncertain.
