# assignments

1. **Reading Memos** (30%)
   
   Most weeks, students will write a research memo or a reaction paper from the
   week's readings. Due on Fridays. Instructions for how to write a research memo
   are available [here](http://chadblack.net/LatAmSport2019/memo/).

2. **Book Review** (20%)
   
   Each student will write a formal review paper of a book of their choosing.
   The book must be an academic monograph on any aspect of the Spanish
   Inquisition in Iberia, Naples, or the Americas. If you'd like, the
   Portuguese or Brazilian Inquisitions will count here too. 

3. **Midterm and Final Exams** (40%)
   
   There will be two in class exams consisting of short answer and
   essay questions. You may bring printed copies of your reading
   memos to aid in your exams.

4. **Self-evaluation on participation** (10%)
   
   Note: Most Thursdays, we will be reading and analyzing cases to
   understand what Inquisition sources offer the modern historian.
   Your participation in those discussions will play a significant part of
   determining this part of your grade.

   Students will write a self-evaluation of their work and participation over the
   semester. Explain how your skills and mastery of the material has developed,
   and what you found most rewarding and most challenging from the course.
   Make a list of each class you did not attend, and explain why you were absent.Refer to [this rubric]() for your evaluation. Give yourself a grade.
